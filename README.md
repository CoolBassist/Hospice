# Hospice
A Basic programming language

To use interpret using Python 3. 

#How to use
In this language there are "cells" that hold values, every cell initially contains the number 0.
You can increase the value by typing "I" for increase, and decrease by "D".
You can change cell by typing "L" for left and "R" for right. 
You can also print the value of the cell by typing "P"

For example.

"IIIIRIIRIPLPLPIIP"

increase the first cell value to 4, then moves to the cell on its right and increases it by 2, then moves right again increases it by one.
Then it prints the value of the cell that its currently on, so it prints "1" then moves left, prints "2" moves left again prints "4" it then increases the value by 2, and then prints the new value, "6".
